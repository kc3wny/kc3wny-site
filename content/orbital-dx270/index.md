## Overview
One of the many projects I've worked on as a member of the Stanford SSI Satellites team has been ensuring availability of our ground stations. Under our mission design for the 2U SAMWISE spacecraft, there are approximately three direct ground passes over the Stanford campus a day, lasting for about five minutes each. A nagging worry has been poorly timed power, internet, or equipment failures could leave us unable to command the spacecraft, which was deemed an unacceptable mission risk.
This project aims to build a small, portable antenna designed to work across the 2m [VHF] and 70cm [UHF] bands and can be stowed in a Pelican case. This ensures we always have the ability to manually track and command our satellite in an emergency situation.
## Technical Specifications
- **Frequency Bands**: 2m [UHF] & 70cm [VHF] [connected via duplexer]
- **Type**: Yagi
- **Intended Modes**: LoRa, FSK, APRS
- **Design Tools**: 4nec2, Fusion360
## Key Features
- **Dual-Band Operation**: Covers 2m [VHF] and 70cm [UHF] bands
- **Compact Stowage**: Custom milled slide-lock hinge allows the frame to fold to half its length, enabling the entire unit to fit inside a small Pelican case
- **Variable Polarization**: Handle assembly features a slotted shaft and friction-damped O-rings, allowing for 90° rotation to switch between vertical and horizontal polarization without remounting
- **Tool-less Deployment**: Spring-loaded detent pins enable the antenna to snap into a rigid, deployed configuration or fold for transport without tools
- **Rugged Construction**: Milled 6061 aluminum square tubing with a powdercoated finish to withstand field conditions and repeated handling
## Architectural Overview
The overall antenna is based on a tape measure Yagi antenna, a very common amateur radio design. While tape measure certainly has structural downsides under high wind loading [where it tends to buckle in equal-sense bending], its antenna properties are great. It’s a precisely machined metal part already dipped in a protective plastic coating, and those same bending properties make it easily folded for transportation meeting one of the project requirements. Threaded rods were also considered, but were ruled out due to fabrication complexity and a projected cost above the ME103-mandated $100 budget. 
To simplify antenna design, two separate Yagi antennas were modeled in 4nec2 for the targeted 2m and 70cm amateur bands, which are the expected C&DH frequency bands for the SSI program over the next ten years. Special care was taken to ensure the two antennas had a common split in the middle to accommodate the frame hinge. For future work this simulation work will be moved to Ansys Electronics Desktop to better control the design of the hairpin matches of the antenna, as the current iteration doesn’t have a wide-band frequency response. 
The main mechanical design work was carried out in Fusion360, and all manufacturing was done manually in the Stanford PRL. Initial cardboard and mixed milled/3D printed prototyping [FIG-005, FIG-006, FIG-007, FIG-008] validated initial human factors and mechanical design, allowing for full production.
The frame was made from 1"x1/8" square 6061 aluminum tubing milled to length, with a slot to accommodate the hinges milled separately. Holes for mounting hardware were then drilled and tapped. The frames were bead-blasted and powdercoated. [FIG-013, FIG-014, FIG-015]
Because a thin aluminum part like this was selected for the primary structure, all fasteners were designed to be installed once to prevent the threads from stripping over time. This drove the decision to use spring-loaded pins to constrain the deployment mechanisms, rather than thumb screws. The center frame hinge is designed as a slider with slots milled in the side, with detents at the beginning and end of travel. When deployed, the slide is equally inserted into the upper and lower frames, and the tight tolerances ensure a rigid frame. The pins locate the detents in the slots, locking the antenna in this configuration. To stow the antenna, simply pull the upper and lower frames apart until the end of travel, where the pins locate the detents and make a hinge. Folding each side 90 degrees allows the antenna frame to fold to half its original length. [FIG-009, FIG-010, FIG-011] This frame hinge was milled from a solid block of 6061 aluminum, and finished with a bead-blast. [FIG-016, FIG-017, FIG-018, FIG-019]
The handle was designed to allow for 90 degrees of rotation, allowing easy switches between vertical and horizontal polarization while mounted to a tripod via the 1/4"-20 mounting point. This was accomplished with a 6061 aluminum turned shaft, with a similar slot/detent cum spring-loaded pin design as the frame hinge milled using a dividing head and polished to reduce lifetime mechanical wear. [FIG-020, FIG-021, FIG-022, FIG-023] The PETG 3D printed handle around it was designed to have o-rings at the top and bottom under precompression to provide weather sealing and enough friction to allow the mechanism to hold any position between 0 and 90 degrees. [FIG-012] The bottom of the handle was designed to accommodate the 2m and 70cm duplexer board.
A decorative nameplate with my amateur radio callsign was sandcasted out of aluminum, with a 3D printed pattern and wooden gate/runner. It was manually faced on the mill to the correct thickness for a friction-fit insertion into the handle. [FIG-024, FIG-025, FIG-026, FIG-027]
Antenna elements were cut on a shear cutter to the correct length, and attached to the frame using PETG clamps and bolts. The driven elements had the plastic coating sanded off and the 50Ω coax cables soldered on, along with the hairpin matches which were tuned using a VNA. [FIG-028, FIG-029, FIG-030, FIG-031, FIG-032, FIG-033, FIG-034]
## Status
Mechanically I am very happy with the final product, with tolerances held at 50 thou or better. There is room for some improvement of course, like the length of the constraining clips for stowing the antenna elements or the placement of the 1/4”-20 threaded hole on the handle, but all core functionality works as intended. On the RF side, VNA tuning revealed the previously mentioned narrow-band behavior, however there is acceptable gain and SWR across both bands despite this error. Better control of the hairpin matches and further simulation should resolve this issue for the second iteration, but for the time being current performance at SAMWISE’s coordinated frequencies is acceptable for a backup ground station solution.
